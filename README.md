# WalkEase
Using Singapore's proprietary mapping service, WalkEase aims to empower the public to personalise their health goals in even the smallest of actions through their walking routes.

This project was created for the Singapore Land Authority-Amazon Web Services Geospatial Innovation Challenge. Our team tackled the challenge statement, "Using OneMap to suggest a walking trail based on oneâ€™s health goals".

# Installation/Running the localhost

If you would like to locally download the repo, we recommend setting up a [virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/).
Install the necessary dependencies with:
<br>
```pip install -r requirements. txt```

To run on localhost, navigate into the **app** folder and use this command in the terminal:
<br>
```streamlit run app.py```
<br>
This will open up a new tab in your browser. To close the session, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the same terminal. 
<br>
<i> *You may need to do this twice to ensure the session has closed.</i>
